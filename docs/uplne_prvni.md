create developer documentation of the future app. I need streamlit app where two employees can log in and see data from remote Snowflake DB. Credentials to Snowflake should be stored in .env file and the app should list all available tables in the remote schema to employee "test1" and if there is logged employee "test2" app will allow also to show table sample (20 rows is enough). ask me more clarifying questions and once you know all the information, create instructions for my junior developer. store design for developers in the file @production_design.md
